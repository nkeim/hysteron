Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

We strongly recommend you start with a Python environment that already includes the numpy and numba packages, such as `Anaconda`_. Otherwise these packages are difficult to install yourself.

To install the latest stable release,

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install hysteron

From sources
------------

The source can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/nkeim/hysteron

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/nkeim/hysteron/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com
.. _Github repo: https://github.com/nkeim/hysteron
.. _tarball: https://github.com/nkeim/hysteron/tarball/master
